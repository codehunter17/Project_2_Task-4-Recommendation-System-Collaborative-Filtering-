## 🧱 Project Workflow:

1. **Data Loading:**  
   Imported movie ratings dataset (CSV).

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   Filtered users and movies for sufficient ratings.

3. **Similarity Calculation:**  
   Used **Cosine Similarity** to measure user-user similarity.

4. **Recommendation Generation:**  
   Predicted top-N movie recommendations for a target user.
